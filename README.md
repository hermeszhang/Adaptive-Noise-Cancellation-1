# Adaptive-Noise-Cancellation
Our project involves implementation of an adaptive noise canceller that takes environmental noise as an input and reduces it in real-time. External sound is ubiquitous; an important requirement of certain environments such as vehicles and aircrafts, is to minimize the noise external to the system in consideration. We have implemented our project using an adaptive filter based on the fast-LMS algorithm and interfaced the FPGA with hardware peripherals, a microphone and a speaker, to capture the noise and play the reduced noise result respectively. We have utilized the audio codec on the FPGA to process the sound signals.
